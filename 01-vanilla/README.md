This is about the simplest universal JavaScript example you can build. However
even with such a trivial example you can see some of the complexities involved
writing universal JavaScript.

This example requires absolutely no dependencies other than nodejs. To run it:

```sh
node server.js
```

or if you have npm (recommended):

```sh
npm start
```

Then browse [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
